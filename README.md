This is a little side-project I have created, and there is a very simple explanation to why it exists:

### I ‚ù§ Geography!

While it is hosted for free at Vercel, the domain name costs a few bucks a year, so I've added an Amazon Affiliate link on the top of the page, so people can buy a product that is like a real life version of this website, and I will get a small comission.

If you think it could be improved in any way, go ahead and make a Pull Request!
